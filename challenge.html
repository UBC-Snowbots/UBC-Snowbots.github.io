                    The most important thing for becoming a new member on this team isn't prior ability, you don't have to have to be a coding
                    wizard! You just have to be willing to pick up the skills necessary when presented with a problem.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The challenges have been created accordingly. With enough perserverance, you should be able to complete them with only basic
                    programming experience.

                <h2>Challenge 1: Getting Set Up</h2>
                <p>
                    All of our development is done on Linux, more specifically Ubuntu. So, your first challenge is to get Ubuntu and our software
                    stack up and running. </br>We've written some instructions to help you along, which
                    can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/UBC-Snowbots/Software_Challenge#installation-and-setup">github repository</a>.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <b>Note:</b> If you can complete the challenges through something other then a native Ubuntu install,
                    such as through a VM or other Linux distro, that's fine too, but we're not going to offer any help getting
                    non-native Ubuntu setup's running.

                <h2>Challenge 2: TurtleSim Sine Wave</h2>
                <p>
                    OK, for this challenge, you'll need some pretty advanced mathematical skills. We're talking basic knowledge of what a sine
                    function is... and that's about it. Seriously though, you don't need to know any advanced maths to join
                    this team. Like I said in the intro, we're looking for people willing to learn
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>As such, your challenge is to have <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim">turtlesim</a> draw out a sine wave.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the build system for <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/">ROS</a> can be kinda complicated, we've provided
                    you most of the framework for what you'll need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <code>~/Software_Challenge/src/challenge/src/solution.cpp</code> you'll find a skeleton project, with a main
                    function and a while loop, alongside a bunch of <a href="#Resources">resources down below</a>. You don't
                    have to use this skeleton project, but we'd recommend it. You should be aiming for a final result that
                    looks something like this:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <b>Note:</b> Please don't just use the keyboard controls to draw this. Yes. We thought of that. As pretty
                    as I'm sure yours is, we're more concerned with your code!
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    <b>Note 2:</b> You can also write your solution in python get started
                    <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber(python)">here</a>, but the resources
                    below are C++ focused, and that's the language we'd prefer you use.
                </blockquote>



                <p>
                    <b>
                        We'd suggest you start by understanding how ROS works <a href="http://robohub.org/ros-101-intro-to-the-robot-operating-system/">here</a>, 
                        then walking through the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials">ROS Tutorials</a> (at least all of section 1.1)
                    </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've done a lot of this stuff already, but it's important that you at least understand it. In particular, <b>#5-6</b>,
                    <b>#11</b>, and <b>#13</b> are important for this challenge. After that, you should be pretty much ready
                    to start! To run the skeleton project we've provided, first source the project by running:
                </p>

                <p><code>$ cd ~/Software_Challenge && source devel/setup.sh</code></p>
                <p>then run</p>
                <p><code>$ rosrun challenge solution</code></p>

                <p>
                    While you're working, we'd suggest you have the

                    <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim">turtlesim reference</a> open (mostly for <b>2.1.1</b> and <b>2.1.2</b>).
                    It also contains some video tutorials, which may be of use. Make sure to take a look at the references
                    for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="http://docs.ros.org/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html">geometry_msgs/Twist</a> (The
                            command you send to the turtlebot)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="http://docs.ros.org/api/turtlesim/html/msg/Pose.html">turtlesim/Pose</a> (what the turtlebot
                            is sending you).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <b>Note: </b> You might however, not have to use the <a href="http://docs.ros.org/api/turtlesim/html/msg/Pose.html">turtlesim/Pose</a>,
                    as there are several ways to solve this problem.

                <h2> Bonus: Make The Turtle Do Something Else</h2>
                <p>
                    The title sums this one up pretty nicely. You don't have to do this challenge, if you've gotten to this point, you've already
                    done pretty well; but we encourage people to try things out and bring it to the interview, it helps us
                    know how familiar you are with our system.
                </p>

                <h2> Super Bonus: Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    This one's a fair bit harder, than the previous ones, so don't worry if you don't get it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this, we want you to re-write the <b>Challenge</b> package into the non-simple configuration specified
                    in the <b>README</b> (the one with testing) and write (and run) some unit tests for your solution!
