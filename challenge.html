                <h4> What we're looking for with this challenge</h4>
                <p> The most important thing for becoming a new member on this team isn't prior ability. You don't have to have to be a coding wizard! What we're looking for is people
                who are persistent, who, when presented with a problem in a subject area they might not understand, work through it, learning as needed. The challenges have been created accordingly. With enough perserverence, you should be able to complete them with only basic programming experience.</p>
                        
                <h4>Who's this challenge for?</h4>
                <p>This challenge is for people who'd like to join our software team. Before you go through it, you might want to make sure we're recruiting <a href="join.html">here</a>. But even if we're not, feel to complete it and <a href="mailto:snowbots.ubc@gmail.com">email us</a>, we might be recruiting again at the start of second semester! </p>

    <section id="Challenge" class="content-section text-center">
         <div class="container-fluid">
            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">

                <h2> Challenge 1: Getting Set Up</h2>
                <p>All of our development is done on Linux, more specifically Ubuntu. So, your first challenge is to get Ubuntu and our software stack up and running. We've written some instructions to help you along, which can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/UBC-Snowbots/IGVC-2017">github repository</a>, under <b>Installation and Setup</b>. <br>
                <i><b>Note:</b> If you can complete the challenges through something other then a native Ubuntu install, such as through a VM or other Linux distro, that's fine too, but we're not going to offer any help getting non-native Ubuntu setup's running</i></p>

                <h2> Challenge 2: TurtleSim Sine Wave</h2>
                <p> OK, for this challenge, you'll need some pretty advanced mathematical skills. We're talking basic knowledge of what a sine function is... and that's about it. Seriousy though, you don't need to know any advanced maths to join this team. Like I said in the intro, we're looking for people willing to learn. As such, your challange is to have <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim">turtlesim</a> draw out a sine wave. Since the build system for <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/">ROS</a> can be kinda complicated (I still don't understand it), we've provided you most of the framework for what you'll need. In <b>~/IGVC-2017/src/challenge/src/solution.cpp</b> you'll find a skeleton project, with a main function and a while loop, alongside a bunch of <a href="#Resources">resources down below</a>. You don't have to use this skeleton project, but we'd recommend it. You should be aiming for a final result that looks something like this:</p>
                <img src="img/turtlesim-sine-wave-solution.png">
                <p><i><b>Note:</b> Please don't just use the keyboard controls to draw this. Yes. We thought of that. As pretty as I'm sure yours is, we're more concerned with your code!<br>
                <b>Note:</b> you can also write your solution in python get started <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber(python)">here</a>, but the resources below are C++ focused, and that's the language we'd prefer</i></p>
                
                <p>We'd suggest you start by understanding how ROS works <a href="http://robohub.org/ros-101-intro-to-the-robot-operating-system/">here</a>, then walking through the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials">ROS Tutorials</a> (at least all of section 1.1) (some commands are different across ROS versions. We're using ROS Kinetic, which is the latest). We've done a lot of this stuff already, but it's important that you at least understand it. In particular, <b>#5-6</b>, <b>#11</b>, and <b>#13</b> are important for this challenge. After that, you should be pretty much ready to start! While you're working, we'd suggest you have the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim">turtlesim reference</a> open (mostly for <b>2.1.1</b> and <b>2.1.2</b>). It also contains some video tutorials, which may be of use. Make sure to take a look at the references for <a href="http://docs.ros.org/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html">geometry_msgs/Twist</a> (What you'll be sending turtlebot) and <a href="http://docs.ros.org/api/turtlesim/html/msg/Pose.html">turtlesim/Pose</a> (what turtlesim will be sending you). You might however, not have to use the <a href="http://docs.ros.org/api/turtlesim/html/msg/Pose.html">turtlesim/Pose</a>, as there are several ways to solve this problem.<br>
                
                <h3> Bonus: Make The Turtle Do Something Else</h3>
                <p> The title sums this one up pretty nicely. You don't have to do this challenge, if you've gotten to this point, you've already done pretty well. But we kinda figured it'd be interesting to see what people come up with. Please don't just copy something from the tutorials, but feel to free to extend the tutorials or even the above challenge.</p>
                
                <h3> Super Bonus: Testing</h3>
                <p>This one's a fair bit harder, then the previous ones, so don't worry if you don't get it. For this, we want you to re-write the <b>Challenge</b> package into the non-simple configuration specified in the <b>README</b> (the one with testing) and write (and run) some unit tests for your solution!</p>

										<h4>References and Resources</h4>
										<p>A good reference for C++ can be found here: <a href ="http://www.cplusplus.com">http://www.cplusplus.com/</a>. It has up-to-date, standards-compliant information, and is my go-to 'reference book'. It also has a tutorial, though I'm sure you can find one if that's what you're looking for.</p>
										<p>Python has some of the best documentation I have ever seen: <a href = "http://www.python.org/doc/"> https://www.python.org/doc/</a>. This covers from the basics to the deepest technicalities of the language and all its built-in modules.
