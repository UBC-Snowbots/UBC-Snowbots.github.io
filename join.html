                <p>
                    Our main recruiting season starts at the beginning of September. We run booths on Imagine Day and host an orientation session
                    a week or two after. During this time you can meet our current team members, see
                    the work that we have done, and learn more about the team.

                    <br/>
                    A smaller recruiting session is opened on January - geared towards experienced members who can learn quick and provide immediate contributions.

                    <br/><br/> All students interested in joining Snowbots are required to attend an interview.
					<!--, in addition
                    those interested in joining the software team are also required to do the <a href="challenge.html">software challenge.</a>-->
                    Schedule an interview by emailing us and we will arrange an interview time for you.

                    <h3 class="icon style2 fa-wrench">Mechanical <br/><span class="sub_h3">Team</span></h3>
                    <p> This team takes care of designing, machining and constructing the robot. They work on the drive-train, robotic arm and the complex chassis, which must navigate difficult terrain and house our many sensors. </p>
                </li>
				<li>
                    <h3 class="icon style4 fa-plug">Electrical <br/><span class="sub_h3">Team</span></h3>
                    <p>
                        The Electrical team works chiefly on wiring, power and control. They create the power supply system, work on our long range communication system and set up firmware/motor control.
                    </p>
                </li>

                    <p>
                        This is our biggest sub-team with the most amount of work. The software team writes code to take in information about the
                        robot’s surroundings and makes decisions about where the to go next. If you are interested in working
                        in pathfinding, mapping, computer vision, networking or systems integration, software has projects
                        for you!

                    <p>
                        The admin sub-team keeps our team running smoothly; they organize meetings, events and travel plans for competition. They
                        are also responsible for all of our funding and sponsor relations.

            </header>
            <h3>Q: I have no experience with anything, will I be able to make it onto the team?</h3>
            <p>
                A: Yes! But you will need to attend an interview and complete the software challenge if you want to join the software team.
                (You can complete the software challenge in your own time and get help from our current members during our
                info session)
            </p>

            <h3>Q: I have missed the Orientation Meeting, can I still join?</h3>
            <p>A: Check this page, we will update it with the status of which teams are still accepting members.</p>

            <h3>Q: I don’t know which sub-team I want to join, what do I do?</h3>
            <p>
                A: Pick one sub-team that sounds interesting to you and go with it. We are somewhat flexible with our members transferring
                between teams, so if you don’t like it you can transfer. Also try talking to some of our current members
                about the different sub-teams you are interested in.
            </p>

            <h3>Q: I am not in Engineering, can I still join the team?</h3>
            <p>
                A: Yes, we accept students from all faculties, all you need is a keen interest in robotics and a keen desire to learn!
